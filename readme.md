# Web Eval

I'm evaluating a few tech stacks to determine which I want to use for a side project I'm spinning up.

So far, the candidates are:

Clojure, Elixir, Node, C#, Go

Of which Clojure is the language I most enjoy.

See [benchmark results](./results.md), with a big grain of salt.

## Structure

Each folder is a small web api project that essentially queries a Postgres db, returning the top 10 records as JSON.

## Database

See the `sql` folder for details on setting up the Postgres db.
